# Movies_Dataset




## Overview
This movie dataset contains information about films, including titles, release dates, genres, cast, crew, production companies, countries, and financial details such as budget, revenue, and profit. The main target variable in this project is movie rating, which is used to analyze factors influencing audience and critic scores. By exploring relationships between features like genre, cast, budget, and box office performance, the dataset enables building predictive models to estimate movie ratings and uncover trends in the film industry.
## Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle and also shared on my profile.

Columns: The main columns include Movie Title, Release Date, Genre, Director, Writer, Main Cast, Production Company, Country, Budget, Revenue, Profit, and Rating. The target variable for this project is Rating, which is used to analyze and predict movie performance.
## Key insights
Ratings show a strong positive correlation with R-rated movies, while genres like Crime, Action, and Horror also contribute positively. In contrast, family-oriented genres such as PG, G, Animation, and Adventure are negatively correlated with ratings. Financial factors like budget, gross, and profit have little to no influence on rating outcomes.
